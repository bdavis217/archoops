    - "password: string().min(6).required()"
  
  teacherRegistrationSchema:
    - "email: string().email().required()"

# Security Considerations
security:
  password_requirements:
    - "Minimum 8 characters for teachers"
    - "Minimum 6 characters for students"
    - "Must include uppercase, lowercase, number for teachers"
  
  jwt_configuration:
    - "Access token: 15 minutes expiration"
    - "Refresh token: 7 days expiration"
    - "Secure HTTP-only cookies for refresh tokens"
  
  class_codes:
    - "6-digit alphanumeric codes"
    - "Expire after 30 days if not used"
    - "Can be regenerated by teachers"
    - "Case-insensitive input"

# Business Logic
business_rules:
  registration:
    - "Email addresses must be unique across all users"
    - "Students must have a valid class code to register"
    - "Teachers can create account without class code"
    - "Email verification required for account activation"
  
  class_management:
    - "Teachers can create unlimited classes"
    - "Class codes are automatically generated"
    - "Students can join multiple classes"
    - "Teachers can remove students from their classes"
    - "Inactive classes don't accept new enrollments"
  
  data_retention:
    - "User accounts remain active until manually deactivated"
    - "Deleted classes archive student data rather than delete"
    - "Login attempts are rate limited (5 attempts per hour)"

# Testing Strategy
testing:
  unit_tests:
    - "Authentication hook functionality"
    - "Password hashing and validation"
    - "JWT token generation and verification"
    - "Form validation schemas"
    - "Class code generation uniqueness"
  
  integration_tests:
    - "User registration flow (Teacher and Student)"
    - "Login/logout flow"
    - "Password reset flow"
    - "Class creation and student enrollment"
    - "Multi-class membership scenarios"
  
  e2e_tests:
    - "Complete teacher onboarding journey"
    - "Complete student onboarding journey"
    - "Class management workflows"
    - "Cross-browser authentication"

# Error Handling
error_scenarios:
  - "Invalid credentials during login"
  - "Email already exists during registration"
  - "Invalid or expired class code"
  - "Network connectivity issues"
  - "Token expiration handling"
  - "Password reset email delivery failures"
  - "Class code collision (rare but possible)"

# Performance Considerations
performance:
  - "Implement login rate limiting"
  - "Cache user profile data locally"
  - "Lazy load class enrollment data"
  - "Optimize database queries with proper indexing"
  - "Use connection pooling for database"

# Accessibility Features
accessibility:
  - "Screen reader compatible forms"
  - "Keyboard navigation for all auth flows"
  - "High contrast mode support"
  - "Form field labels and error announcements"
  - "Loading state announcements"

# Future Enhancements
future_features:
  - "OAuth integration (Google, Microsoft)"
  - "Two-factor authentication"
  - "Advanced role permissions"
  - "Bulk student import via CSV"
  - "Parent/guardian accounts"
  - "SSO for school districts"
